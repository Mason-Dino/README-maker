## About The Project

![](https://github.com/Mason-Dino/README-maker/blob/main/screenshots/product-1.png?raw=true)

ReadMe-Maker is a electron passed application to allow developers to make fantastic looking Readme files for their Github or Gitlab repos. I wanted to develop this project because I wanted to have an easier time developing a Readme for all of my projects.

## Built With

Readme-Maker is uses electron on a backend with nodejs. These are the major frameworks and languages used within Readme-Maker and it allowed me to make this application that you are looking at.

*   [Node.js v22.14.0](https://nodejs.org/en)
*   [Electron](https://www.electronforge.io/)
*   [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/)
*   [Turndown](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown)

## Getting Started

Below there are steps on how to host Readme-maker localy on your own device.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the latest version of npm and nodejs on your machine and that can be done by running the command below.

*   npm
    
        npm install npm@latest -g
        
    

### Installation

Below is how to get all the code on your local machine to then be able to run this electron application to make a nice looking README file.

1.  Clone the repo
    
        git clone https://github.com/Mason-Dino/README-maker.git
        
    
2.  Install NPM packages
